/**
 * @brief Driver of splits for a scan operator.
 *
 * Composes an @c io::gpu_ingestible and delegates the per-format work to it.
 * Exposes two thread-safe primitives:
 *   - @ref has_more_splits — snapshot check for remaining work.
 *   - @ref next_split_provider — atomically claim the next batch and return a
 *     callable that processes it.
 *
 * Splitting the claim from the work lets @ref run() enqueue one task per
 * batch on the driver thread without serialising metadata processing
 * behind a chain of "claim-then-run" tasks. The connector is closed in the
 * shared @c worker_state's destructor, which fires when the last enqueued
 * task releases its @c shared_ptr; any captured exception
 * (first-writer-wins via atomic CAS) is forwarded so consumers see the
 * failure through @ref split_connector::get_next_split.
 *
 * Historical note: this class was abstract pre-gpu_ingestible refactor.
 * Legacy subclasses (parquet_split_provider, duckdb_native_split_provider,
 * cached_split_provider) override @ref has_more_splits and
 * @ref next_split_provider; they are scheduled for deletion in step 10 of
 * the refactor. The default (concrete) construction path takes a
 * @c shared_ptr<io::gpu_ingestible> and uses the base's default
 * implementations to delegate to it.
